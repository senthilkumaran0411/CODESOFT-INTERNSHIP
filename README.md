CodSoft Java Development Internship
Welcome to My Java Development Journey!

This repository is a chronicle of my exciting journey as a Java Development Intern at CodSoft. Here, I'll be working on a series of challenging tasks designed to enhance my skills and knowledge in Java development. Join me as I explore the world of Java and learn from my experiences!

Task Overview
Task 1: Number Guessing Game
Guess the secret number! In this task, I'll create a game that generates random numbers, prompts user guesses, and provides feedback. The game will allow multiple rounds, and I'll calculate scores to keep track of the user's progress.

Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
Get ready to calculate those grades! In this task, I'll develop a program that calculates total marks and average percentage for students. The program will assign grades based on the calculated scores and display the results in a user-friendly format.

Task 3: ATM Interface
Time to manage your finances! In this task, I'll create an ATM class with methods for withdrawing, depositing, and checking account balances. I'll implement input validation to ensure secure transactions and connect the ATM with a user's bank account.

Task 4: Currency Converter
Exchange rates at your fingertips! In this task, I'll develop a program that converts currencies using real-time exchange rates. The program will provide a user-friendly interface for currency conversion, making it easy to navigate.

Task 5: Student Management System
Manage students with ease! In this task, I'll design a Student Management System using Java classes. The system will allow users to interact with the system, store data, and manage student information efficiently.
